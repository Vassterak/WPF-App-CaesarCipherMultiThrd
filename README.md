# WPF-CaesarCipher

A simple program that "encrypts" string with Caesar cipher.
It's a primitive encryption that uses char shift.
The point of this homework is to create an app that will apply this type of encryption on large text. And to avoid slowdown, the app must use multithreading.  

**The App UI is in Czech beause it's school homework.**

## What it can do?
